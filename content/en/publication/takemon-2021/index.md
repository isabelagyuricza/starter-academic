abstract: textlessptextgreaterLittle is known about the molecular changes that take
  place in the kidney during the aging process. In order to better understand these
  changes, we measured mRNA and protein levels in genetically diverse mice at different
  ages. We observed distinctive change in mRNA and protein levels as a function of
  age. Changes in both mRNA and protein are associated with increased immune infiltration
  and decreases in mitochondrial function. Proteins show a greater extent of change
  and reveal changes in a wide array of biological processes including unique, organ-specific
  features of aging in kidney. Most importantly, we observed functionally important
  age-related changes in protein that occur in the absence of corresponding changes
  in mRNA. Our findings suggest that mRNA profiling alone provides an incomplete picture
  of molecular aging in the kidney and that examination of changes in proteins is
  essential to understand aging processes that are not transcriptionally regulated.textless/ptextgreater
