 I have been interested in mammalian genetics since my undergrad, when I first learned about the different types of mouse inbred strains and how unique they are. But it was during my master's that I realized how mixing these different genetic backgrounds can cause such an extreme effect on phenotypes related to diseases, such as Marfan Syndrome. My interest on genetic variability in mice + my wish for learning computational biology brought me to the Churchill Lab (The Jackson Laboratory), where I learned that generating mice with a degree of genetic variability similar to the human population is possible. Here, we use computational approaches to look for biological meaning in genomics and proteomics data from the Diversity Outbred - the coolest multiparental mouse population.
