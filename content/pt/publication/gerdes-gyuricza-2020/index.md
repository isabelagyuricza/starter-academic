abstract: Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a connective tissue disease caused by variants
  in the FBN1 gene. Nevertheless, other genes influence the manifestations of the
  disease, characterized by high clinical variability even within families. We mapped
  modifier loci for cardiovascular and skeletal manifestations in the mg∆loxPneo mouse
  model for MFS and the synthenic loci in the human genome. Corroborating our findings,
  one of those loci was identified also as a modifier locus in MFS patients. Here,
  we investigate the HSPG2 gene, located in this region, as a candidate modifier gene
  for MFS. We show a correlation between Fbn1 and Hspg2 expression in spinal column
  and aorta in non-isogenic mg∆loxPneo mice. Moreover, we show that mice with severe
  phenotypes present lower expression of Hspg2 than those mildly affected. Thus, we
  propose that HSPG2 is a strong candidate modifier gene for MFS and its role in modulating
  disease severity should be investigated in patients.
