abstract: Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a monogenic disease of high mortality, affecting
  millions of people worldwide. There is no broad, effective, and safe definitive
  treatment for SCA, so the palliative treatments are the most used. The establishment
  of an in vitro model allows better understanding of how the disease occurs, besides
  allowing the development of more effective tests and treatments. In this context,
  iPSC technology is a powerful tool for basic research and disease modeling, and
  a promise for finding and screening more effective and safe drugs, besides the possibility
  of use in regenerative medicine. This work obtained a model for study and treatment
  of SCA using iPSC. Then, episomal vectors were used for reprogramming peripheral
  blood mononuclear cells to obtain integration-free iPSC. Cells were collected from
  patients treated with hydroxyurea and without treatment. The iPSCP Bscd lines were
  characterized for pluripotent and differentiation potential. The iPSC lines were
  differentiated into HSC, so that we obtained a dynamic and efficient protocol of
  CD34+CD45+ cells production. We offer a valuable tool for a better understanding
  of how SCA occurs, in addition to making possible the development of more effective
  drugs and treatments and providing better understanding of widely used treatments,
  such as hydroxyurea.
